# QA and testing

Quality assurance (QA) testing is critical to the reliability and stability of
Ubuntu, and is an excellent way to get started as a contributor.

Testing doesn't require any special setup -- it can be as simple as running the
latest version of Ubuntu, reporting any issues you find as bugs, and
helping to manage any bugs you find until they are fixed.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can also help test out new pre-release
versions of Ubuntu!
