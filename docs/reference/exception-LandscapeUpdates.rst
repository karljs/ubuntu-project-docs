This document describes the policy for updating Landscape client
packages in a stable supported distro, be it LTS or not.

Landscape is a commercial service from Canonical which periodically
offers new features to its customers. Being a client-server product, the
client part needs to be periodically updated in order to take advantage
of the new features. Therefore, new features are allowed in an update
**as long as the conditions outlined below are met**.
