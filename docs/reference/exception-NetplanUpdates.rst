**DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT**

This document describes the policy for updating Curtin in a stable
supported distro, including LTS.

Curtin (the curt installer) is a "fast path" installer designed to
install Ubuntu quickly. It is blunt, brief, snappish, snippety and
unceremonious. Periodically Curtin needs to be updated in order to take
advantage of new features and bug fixes. Therefore, in addition to bug
fixes, new features are allowed in an update as long as the conditions
outlined below are met.
