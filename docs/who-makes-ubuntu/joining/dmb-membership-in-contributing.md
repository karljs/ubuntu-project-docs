# Ubuntu Contributing Developers

Ubuntu Contributing Developers are members of the [`ubuntu-developer-members`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-developer-members) team in Launchpad.
They have demonstrated *significant and sustained* contributions in the area of {ref}`ubuntu-development` -- see {ref}`member-requirements` for guidance on what our expectations are for "significant" and "sustained".
  
Contributing Developers are implicitly considered Ubuntu Members, and continue with sponsored uploads as a Prospective Developer would.

First check the general requirements for {ref}`ubuntu-membership`.
You can then apply to the {ref}`dmb` using the {ref}`dmb-application`.
