Ubuntu Developers represent an important part of the creation of Ubuntu. They
have a direct influence on the software included in Ubuntu and whether it meets
the needs of end users. They are responsible for ensuring that Ubuntu works, and
works as well as it can with the resources available.

Everybody is welcome to work on any package they want to improve and we value
these contributions. If you don't have upload rights yet,
{ref}`sponsors <sponsorship>` can review your work and upload it for you.

If you wanted to categorize the different kinds of involvement and upload rights
in Ubuntu, it would look like this:

* {ref}`ubuntu-developers-prospective` who probably just started contributing
  to Ubuntu.

* {ref}`ubuntu-developers-contributing`, who were recognized with
  {ref}`ubuntu-membership`.

* {ref}`Per-Package Uploaders (PPU) <ubuntu-developers-per-package>`,
  who can upload specific packages.

* {ref}`Package Set uploaders <membership-in-packageset>`

* {ref}`Ubuntu Developers (from delegated teams) <ubuntu-developers-delegated>`,
  who can upload to a specific [Package Set](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArchiveReorganisation/Permissions).

* {ref}`MOTU <ubuntu-developers-motu>`, who can upload to
  {ref}`universe and multiverse <archive-components>`.

* {ref}`SRU developers <ubuntu-developers-sru>`, who can upload any package but
  only to stable releases.

* {ref}`Ubuntu Core Developers (core-dev) <ubuntu-developers-core-dev>`,
  who can upload to all areas of Ubuntu.


## Benefits

Ubuntu Developers get all the {ref}`benefitsof Ubuntu Membership <member-perks>`.
They also get:

* Voting privileges to confirm Ubuntu [Technical Board](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard) and {ref}`dmb` nominations.

* The opportunity to be nominated for the Developer Membership Board.

* Access to all [Valve-produced games for Steam](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2014-February/001079.html).

```{note}
A few Per-Package Uploaders are not members of [`ubuntu-dev`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-dev) and are not eligible for these benefits.
One way to check this is to run `bin/lp-check-membership` from the `lptools` package.
