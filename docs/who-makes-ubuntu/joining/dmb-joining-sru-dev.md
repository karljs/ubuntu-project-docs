# SRU Developers

SRU Developers are developers with a specialisation in working on [stable release updates](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/) in Ubuntu.
They are granted direct upload to the Ubuntu Archive for all packages -- but only to the stable releases.

SRU Devs have uploads subject to the standard SRU process, including review from SRU team members and all other SRU policies.
They have a good track record of sponsored SRUs, thus demonstrating an understanding of SRU policies, requirements and process.

They also drive SRUs through to the end, not letting things languish in `-proposed`.
Developers who focus on package-specific areas in Ubuntu, such as MOTU and Package Set uploaders also upload SRUs without necessarily being a member of the SRU developers team.
By contrast, SRU developers work on SRUs across different sections of the Ubuntu Package Archive.

SRU Developers are granted a vote when the {ref}`Development Membership Board <dmb>` or Technical Board are polling {ref}`Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-developers>`.
