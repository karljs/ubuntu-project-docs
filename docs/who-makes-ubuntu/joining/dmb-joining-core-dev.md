# Membership in Core Developers

{ref}`Core Developers <ubuntu-developers-core-dev>` (Core Devs) are members of the `ubuntu-core-dev` team in Launchpad.
Core Devs maintain all packages in Ubuntu, which notably includes uploading to the `main` component.
Core Devs also have elevated privileges for re-triggering autopkgtests and performing other administrative actions in Ubuntu.

## Training and preparation

Most people applying for Core Dev membership will have a history of involvement in Ubuntu, working their way up from {ref}`Package Set <membership-in-packageset>` and/or {ref}`MOTU <membership-in-MOTU>` membership.
If you're skipping over those levels it is nevertheless worth reviewing their training and application processes to make sure you'll be fulfilling their requirements.

In addition to understanding common tasks documented in this guide, including {ref}`Debian patching <work-with-debian-patches>`, {ref}`Stable Release Updates (SRUs) <fix-a-bug-in-a-package>`, and so on, Core Dev applicants must also have a good understanding of these advanced packaging skills, and ideally direct experience with a few of them:

* {ref}`Package sponsorship <sponsorship>`
* {ref}`Seed handling <seed-management>`
* {ref}`Main inclusion <main-inclusion-review>` for packages
* [New package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages) integration
* {ref}`Transition <transitions>` of packages with new ABI/API requirements
* [SRU special case exceptions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/package-specific/)

As with applications for {ref}`MOTU <membership-in-MOTU>`, trustworthiness is crucial for Core Devs.
Being able to work with others, and especially *mentoring* others is extremely important.
Look for opportunities to exercise and demonstrate these attributes, and discuss them in your application.


## Further information

While Core Dev is the highest level for packaging development, there are several specialized administrative teams that help keep the Archive healthy:

* {ref}`dmb`
* [Technical Board](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard)
* {ref}`Archive Administration <archive-administration>`
* {ref}`ubuntu-developers-sru`
* [Security](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam)
