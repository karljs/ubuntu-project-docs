## Delegation

[Team delegation procedure](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers/TeamDelegation)

The DMB currently delegated approval privileges to:

* The [Desktop team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-desktop) -- [Policy](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Developers)

* The [Kubuntu team](https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-dev) -- [Policy](https://community.kde.org/Kubuntu/Developers)

* The [Mythbuntu team](https://launchpad.net/~mythbuntu-dev) -- `Policy: http://www.mythbuntu.org/development/policy`

  **TODO: broken link**

* The [Kernel team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel-uploaders) -- [Policy](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/UploadRights)

This delegation includes individual per-package upload privileges for packages
that are in the corresponding team package set.



(form-a-delegated-team)=
## Form a delegated team

* Email `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com` with:

  * A description of your set of packages. The Developer Membership Board will
    use this description to verify which packages should belong to the set. This
    description should contain a name for the package set, and set out criteria
    against which packages can be tested for membership.

  * An initial list of packages.

  * An initial list of members (with their Launchpad IDs).

* The Developer Membership Board, at its next meeting (providing this is more
  than 7 days after the application), will discuss the package set with the
  applicants and then vote on its creation. When applying for a set, please be
  prepared to attend a DMB meeting.

* The Developer Membership Board will take care of creating the package set and
  ensuring that the requested permissions are granted.


## Requesting changes to delegated teams

* Email `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com` with the proposed change(s) and the
  packageset to which the change applies.
  
* A Developer Membership Board member will review the request and either make
  the change or ask for further clarification if it us unclear that the package
  falls under the delegation granted when the team was created.
