# Developer Membership Board

The Ubuntu Developer Membership Board grants Membership to {ref}`Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-developer-membership>`.
The term for DMB membership is 2 years.
You can find the list of current [Developer Membership Board members](https://launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+members) on Launchpad.


## Communication

The DMB currently meets every two weeks in {matrix}`meeting` on Monday alternating between 13:00 UTC and 15:30 UTC.
See [DMB agenda](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-developer-membership-board-agenda/66634).

Most asynchronous conversation happens on the [`devel-permissions` mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions).
This mailing list is public ([`devel-permissions@archives`](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/)), as are our general process and policy discussions.
If private communication is required, such as discussing the performance of an individual, then use the [private `developer-membership-board` list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/developer-membership-board). A private Matrix room may also be used (by invitation only).
  
You can discuss developer application matters on the {matrix}`devel` Matrix channel.
