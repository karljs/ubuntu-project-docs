# Developer Membership Board

More information available at:

* **Responsibilities, permissions and more information
  {ref}`about Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-developers>`**
* {ref}`More general information about Ubuntu Development <ubuntu-development>`

The Ubuntu Developer Membership Board operates on the following basis:

* The list of Developer Membership Board members
  [can be found on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+members).
  The term for DMB membership is 2 years.

* You can reach the board by emailing `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com`.
  This mailing list is public ([devel-permissions@ archives](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/))
  and our general process and policy discussions are public; if exceptionally
  private communication is required, such as discussing the performance of an
  individual, then use the private list at `developer-membership-board@lists.ubuntu.com`.
  
* Or you can discuss developer application matters on
  [IRC](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC) at `#ubuntu-devel`.


## Application process

The Ubuntu Developer Membership Board currently approves:

* {ref}`Contributing Developers <ubuntu-developers-contributing>` (Ubuntu Membership)

* {ref}`Per-Package Uploaders <ubuntu-developers-per-package>`

* {ref}`SRU Developers <ubuntu-developers-sru>`

* {ref}`MOTU <ubuntu-developers-motu>`

* {ref}`Core Developers <ubuntu-developers-core-dev>`

To apply, {ref}`follow this process <dmb-application>`.

The following changes [were agreed on](http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2009/10/13/%23ubuntu-meeting.html):

* [`devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com`](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions) list will be used.

* Invitations/applications go there as well as to relevant team lists.

* All approvals go to `ubuntu-devel@` (meeting minutes) and `devel-permissions@`
  (individual outcomes) (maybe also to the team list)

The implementation of the application process might vary across teams slightly,
but we expect the following very general procedure:

* Documentation

* Declaring intent

* Discussion with applicant

* Public announcement
