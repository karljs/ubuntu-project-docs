# Developer Membership Board

The Ubuntu Developer Membership Board grants Membership to {ref}`Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-developers>`.
The term for DMB membership is 2 years.
You can find the list of current [Developer Membership Board members](https://launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+members) on Launchpad.


## Communication

The DMB currently meets every two weeks in [`#meeting:ubuntu.com`](https://matrix.to/#/#meeting:ubuntu.com) on Monday alternating between 13:00 UTC and 15:30 UTC.
See [DMB agenda](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-developer-membership-board-agenda/66634).

You can reach the board by emailing `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com`.
This mailing list is public ([`devel-permissions@archives`](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/)) and our general process and policy discussions are public;
if exceptionally private communication is required, such as discussing the performance of an individual, then use the private list at `developer-membership-board@lists.ubuntu.com`.
  
You can discuss developer application matters on the [`#devel:ubuntu.com`](https://matrix.to/#/#devel:ubuntu.com).


## Applying for Developer Membership

The Ubuntu Developer Membership Board currently approves:

* {ref}`Contributing Developers <ubuntu-developers-contributing>` (Ubuntu Membership)

The following changes [were agreed on](http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2009/10/13/%23ubuntu-meeting.html):

* [`devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com`](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions) list will be used.

* Invitations/applications go there as well as to relevant team lists.

* All approvals go to `ubuntu-devel@` (meeting minutes) and `devel-permissions@`
  (individual outcomes) (maybe also to the team list)


The implementation of the application process might vary {ref}`across delegated teams <dmb-delegation>` slightly, but we generally expect the following:

* Documentation
