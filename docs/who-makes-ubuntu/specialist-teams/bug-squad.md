# The Bug Squad

The Bug Squad is an essential asset in progressing Ubuntu and its flavours; the
Bug Squad is the first point of contact for bugs filed about Ubuntu.


## Who is in the Bug Squad?

Anyone interested in triaging bugs can join the Bug Squad. The
[members](https://launchpad.net/~bugsquad/+members) are primarily volunteers
from around the world, who come together with the common cause of making
Ubuntu better for everyone.

**No special knowledge or training is required**, just a desire to help!


## What the team does

What the Bug Squad does is also known as {ref}`triaging-bugs`, a
process that ensures bug reports are complete, that the bug can be reproduced,
and that its priority is assessed and set.

This allows developers to spend their time more effectively. It's also a great
way to learn how Ubuntu works as an operating system and as a community. Itâ€™s
also not uncommon for triagers to discover new and interesting features they
didn't know about.

Triaging bugs consists of:

* Responding to new bugs as they are filed
* Ensuring that new bugs have all the necessary information
* Assigning bugs to the proper package
* Confirming bug reports by trying to reproduce them
* Setting the importance of bugs reports ({ref}`bug-control-team` team only)
* Searching for and marking duplicates in the bug-tracking system
* Sending bugs to their upstream authors, when applicable
* Cross-referencing bugs from other distributions
* Expiring old bugs

Bug triage is an excellent way to start helping out. You get to learn a lot
about Ubuntu, its available packages, its infrastructure, and you get a feel
for the development pulse.

Another big part of what we do is help new members to triage bugs. On average,
over 1,800 bugs are filed every week with more than 500,000 bugs filed so far.
The Bug Squad is always in NEED of more help from the community!
