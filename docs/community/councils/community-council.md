# Community Council

The Ubuntu Community Council is the primary community (i.e., non-technical) governance body for the Ubuntu project. Members are appointed by Mark Shuttleworth and approved by a vote by the entire Ubuntu membership.

More information on the council and on Ubuntu governance in general is on the [Ubuntu Governance page](https://ubuntu.com/community/governance).

## Delegation

The Community Council [chose to delegate some of its powers and responsibilities (like approval of Ubuntu membership) to Team Councils](https://ubuntu.com/community/governance/delegation).

The governance bodies that need to be restaffed (because of members stepping down or term lengths running out), follow the restaffing process.

## Membership

The current membership of the council is listed on [its Launchpad page](https://launchpad.net/~communitycouncil/+members).

## Contact Info

You may contact the Community Council by posting a topic in this category or by sending an email to [community-council@lists.ubuntu.com](mailto:community-council@lists.ubuntu.com). **All Ubuntu community-related queries and questions are welcome.**
