# Matrix Moderators

As described in {ref}`matrix-moderation-and-defense`, Moderators foster the Ubuntu community by ensuring Matrix rooms provide a safe and welcoming environment.
Moderators protect specific Matrix rooms, because each room or space might have slightly different purpose and goals.
Having said that, they must all abide by the {ref}`Ubuntu Code of Conduct <code-of-conduct>`.


# How to become a Moderator

Moderators are chosen by room administrators.
More information on how to become a moderator can be found in {ref}`how-to-become-a-moderator`.


# How to contact a Moderator

Moderators can be found directly in the Matrix room you are using.
You can identify moderators with the "Mod" tag in the "People" panel.
For specific instructions, refer to {ref}`moderators-contact`.
