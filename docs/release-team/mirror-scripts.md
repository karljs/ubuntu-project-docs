# Mirror scripts

To create a mirror people can rely on, you need to have all the files, and you
need them at the right moment. "File not found" errors cause a lot of issues
and annoyances for users. This page provides you with scripts to sync from other
mirrors and prevent 404's.

## ubumirror

You can use the scripts from the
[`ubumirror`](https://code.launchpad.net/~ubumirror-devs/ubumirror/trunk)
project to keep your mirror in sync, or use the scripts provided below. Please
file any bug reports you find
[against it](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubumirror).


## Archive mirrors

For Archive mirrors, it is very important **not** to delete packages before the
`Packages.gz` files (which hold information about the packages available) are
updated.

Therefore, you need a "**two-stage sync**". This means that you download new
packages first, and the new `Packages.gz` after that. After you've downloaded
the `Packages.gz` files, it's safe to delete old packages.


```none
#/bin/dash

fatal() {
  echo "$1"
  exit 1
}

warn() {
  echo "$1"
}

# Find a source mirror near you which supports rsync on
# https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors
# rsync://<iso-country-code>.rsync.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu should always work
RSYNCSOURCE=rsync://archive.ubuntu.mirror.isp.com/ubuntu

# Define where you want the mirror-data to be on your mirror
BASEDIR=/var/www/ubuntuarchive/

if [ ! -d ${BASEDIR} ]; then
  warn "${BASEDIR} does not exist yet, trying to create it..."
  mkdir -p ${BASEDIR} || fatal "Creation of ${BASEDIR} failed."
fi

rsync --recursive --times --links --safe-links --hard-links \
  --stats \
  --exclude "Packages*" --exclude "Sources*" \
  --exclude "Release*" --exclude "InRelease" \
  ${RSYNCSOURCE} ${BASEDIR} || fatal "First stage of sync failed."

rsync --recursive --times --links --safe-links --hard-links \
  --stats --delete --delete-after \
  ${RSYNCSOURCE} ${BASEDIR} || fatal "Second stage of sync failed."

date -u > ${BASEDIR}/project/trace/$(hostname -f)
```


## Releases mirrors

For Releases mirrors, things are a little less complicated. There are no
dependencies between files, so you can just `rsync`.


```none
#/bin/dash

fatal() {
  echo "$1"
  exit 1
}

warn() {
  echo "$1"
}

# Find a source mirror near you which supports rsync on
# https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors
# rsync://<iso-country-code>.rsync.releases.ubuntu.com/releases should always work
RSYNCSOURCE=rsync://releases.ubuntu.mirror.isp.com/releases

# Define where you want the mirror-data to be on your mirror
BASEDIR=/var/www/ubuntureleases/

if [ ! -d ${BASEDIR} ]; then
  warn "${BASEDIR} does not exist yet, trying to create it..."
  mkdir -p ${BASEDIR} || fatal "Creation of ${BASEDIR} failed."
fi

rsync --verbose --recursive --times --links --safe-links --hard-links \
  --stats --delete-after \
  ${RSYNCSOURCE} ${BASEDIR} || fatal "Failed to rsync from ${RSYNCSOURCE}."

date -u > ${BASEDIR}/.trace/$(hostname -f)
```
