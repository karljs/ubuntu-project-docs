Once an Ubuntu release has been completed and published, updates for it
are only released under certain circumstances, and must follow a special
procedure called a "stable release update" or SRU.

This documentation describes the principles and processes we follow in
order to keep stable Ubuntu releases stable.

Our documented principles are intended to be read by all Ubuntu users if
they wish to understand what to expect from Ubuntu stable releases, and
are for upstream and Ubuntu developers to read if they wish to
understand what changes would or would not be acceptable to us. The rest
is intended for Ubuntu developers and SRU team members to achieve this
in practice.
