SRU documentation
=================

.. A single sentence that says what the product is, succinctly and
   memorably.

*Stable release updates* (SRUs) are package updates to a currently supported Ubuntu release.

.. A paragraph of one to three short sentences, that describe what the
   product does.

Once an Ubuntu release has been completed and published, updates for it
are only released under certain circumstances, and must follow a special
procedure called SRU.

.. A third paragraph of similar length, this time explaining what need the
   product meets.

This documentation describes the SRU principles and processes we follow in
order to keep stable Ubuntu releases stable and predictable.

.. Finally, a paragraph that describes whom the product is useful for.

Our documented principles are intended to be read by all Ubuntu users if
they wish to understand what to expect from Ubuntu stable releases, and
are for upstream and Ubuntu developers to read if they wish to
understand what changes would or would not be acceptable to us. The rest
is intended for Ubuntu developers and SRU team members to achieve this
in practice.

.. important::
    Did you **notice a regression** in a package that went to the ``-updates`` pocket?
    Please report this by following :ref:`howto-report-regression`.
