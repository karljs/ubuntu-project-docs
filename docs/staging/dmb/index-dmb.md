The Ubuntu Membership Board is responsible for approving new
[Ubuntu members](https://ubuntu.com/community/membership). They manage the
[membership application process](https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/application).

The membership board meets three times a month to discuss new membership
applicants. They analyse the application and investigate whether the applicant
meets the [membership requirements](https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/requirements).

The board contains seven members. You can see the current members in the
Ubuntu Membership Board [group in Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-membership-board).
