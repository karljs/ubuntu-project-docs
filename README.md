# Ubuntu project docs

This repository contains the sources for the [Ubuntu Project Documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/project/).

It is documentation about the workings of the Ubuntu project. These docs aim
to encompass the entirety of the processes that together form the
fundamentals of creating, releasing, and maintaining the Ubuntu Linux
distribution. The documentation is structured into three pillars:

* Governance and community
* Development
* Archive handling

## Publishing

The documentation is published using Sphinx and hosted on Read the Docs: [![Documentation Status](https://app.readthedocs.com/projects/canonical-ubuntu-project/badge/?version=latest)](https://app.readthedocs.com/projects/canonical-ubuntu-project/badge/?version=latest)
